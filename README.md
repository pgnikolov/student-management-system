A simple command-line student management system written in Python. This project allows users to manage 
student records by adding, updating, deleting, searching, and listing student information.

## Features 🧰
- Add Student: Add new student records.
- Update Student: Update existing student records.
- Delete Student: Remove student records.
- Search Student: Search for student records by name.
- List All Students: List all student records.

## Current Status

The project is currently in active development, with significant changes underway to enhance its functionality and improve the main concept.
We are transitioning from storing records in a `JSON` file to using `Excel` files for better data management and manipulation directly from the code.

## Roadmap  

* **Transition to Excel-Based Data Management**

    We are currently implementing functionality to create, load, and save student records using Excel files directly within the code. 
    This change will provide users with more robust data management capabilities and easier manipulation of student information.

* **Enhanced User Interaction**

    We plan to improve the user interaction experience by adding features such as customizable Excel file creation, 
    allowing users to define the structure of their student records directly from the application.

* **Expanded Functionality**

    Future updates will focus on expanding the functionality of the application, including advanced search options, 
    sorting capabilities, and the ability to generate reports directly from the Excel data.
